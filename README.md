## Overview

This project was my first in a while using React, and was created with the purpose of being my portfolio. Present on the site are my resume, and a contact form connected to my email address. CSS was a large part of this project and using advanced 3D animations was most definitely a challenge, but a fun one at that. This was also my first time using Leaflet for creating live maps like the one on the site.
